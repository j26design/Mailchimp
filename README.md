A public place to request features and report bugs for the Mailchimp widget built for Adobe Muse.

## Bugs/Features

### Reporting Bugs

#### File uploads

If your website is not live, I will likely need the .muse file to be able to identify bug. In these cases, you can easily upload your .[muse file here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/IZ9vUxuqIFgTUbKYGXon). I will be the only one that will be able to view the file.
